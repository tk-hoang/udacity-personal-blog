            <p>We have been looking for an <strong>appartment</strong> to buy for more than a year. It took a long time and for several reasons.
            The first one is the demand for housing is huge in Brussels and good value properties get sold immediatly.
            We were first looking in our neighbourhood because it is a very central location : next to the train station and close to the subway.
            However price are crazy even for very small appartment. The quality is not great either : <strong>no quiet street, no great views, a lot renovation to do</strong>.
            <br><br>
            We looked at houses in the suburb but after a few visits, we dropped the idea. My husband does not have his driving licence and getting an uber or delivery is a lot more difficult.
            I cannot accept also to spend 10Kâ‚¬ on a car whereas I prefer to spend it on an appartment because it is the type of asset that <strong>gains value over time</strong>.
            <br><br>
            So after browsing <a id="article-link" href="https://www.immoweb.be/en">immoweb</a> for a long time, we saw this building which has 3 units. We also knew that both of our brothers were also looking to buy.
            It was the perfect project for all of us. The only issue was that the day of the open house was on our wedding day. We knew the buiding would be sold on the same day.
            So with some guests and our families, after the wedding lunch, we rushed to the visit. I was, of course, still wearing my wedding gown.
            <br><br>
            We wrote the offer for the house in our honeymoon suite at the hotel. Because of our crazy story, the sellers decided that they loved our project and accepted our offer.
            <br><br>
            We are so happy with this purchase and hope that we will build happy family memories there.
